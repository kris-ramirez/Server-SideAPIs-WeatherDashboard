# Server-SideAPIs-WeatherDashboard

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation behind this project was to create an application that accessed a third-aprty API. This application was to be used to access the current and five-day weather forecast for any given city. Unfortunately I was not able to complete my code. I did learn how to access data from an API but I still need work on how to display that information using CSS and bootstrap, and working with local storage. I also completed this challenge the week we had a project. I will return to this when I have more time and complete my code. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application visit this link: 

There you will find a search box to enter a city. 

The hours are color coded based on the current time of day. hour 4 is in red for the current time

You can add/save events to your schedule and they will stay on the page when it is refreshed. Late lunch added to 2PM


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
